\section pool Pool
The class \ref dynamicgraph::PoolStorage keeps track of the entities instanciated with the factory.
The entities are the graph nodes. Signals are constructed during the class instanciation, they do not live
independently from the entities. Signals are the directed edges of the graph. The pool can write a file representing
the graph of entities.
